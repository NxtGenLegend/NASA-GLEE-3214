Data Points To Be Added

Notes:
Mid-Latitude for max sunlight
Capacitive sensor In-Contact with regolith constantly
Few feet away / immediate sensor ranges for thermopile (and possibly IR)
100 m magnetic field generalization (Is of the LunaSat)
1 Earth Week mission duration
May have real-time data
No external computing or sensors
No program uploads post-launch
Specific Sampling Approach - No need to make excessive assumptions

Light, IR, Temperature, Albedo, Wein's Displacement and potentially Solar Flares favored with ML algorithms
OR
Lunar Regolith Sampling

KEEP IT SIMPLE - PROGRAMMATIC PROBLEM

Possible Missions:
Seismic Activity- Accelerometer, Magnetometer
Lunar Surface Characterization (Regolith & Composition)- Capacitive Sensor, Magnetometer, Temperature Sensor, Thermopile, Solar Panel (Fourier's Law of Heat Conduction)

Temperature Variations- Thermopile, Temperature Sensor
Albedo (Light Intensity Profiling)- Solar Panel, Thermopile, Temperature Sensor (Energy Balance Equations & Emissivity)
